FusionSolar modules are powerful and built tougher than industry standards and are also attractive.
We provide several size and color options to cater to homeowners’ preference

## Why choose FusionSolar

Points[

1-20 Years of Solar History

Employing its patent-protected technology, FusionSolar panels are unsurpassed in quality, efficiency, and design.

2- High Solar Standards

From material selection to manufacturing protocols, FusionSolar solar panels are built with the highest solar standards and reliability.

3-Better Shade Tolerance

With conventional panels, shade can be a problem; the panel energy output drops to zero if 10% or more of the panel is shaded.As a homeowner, you won’t have to worry about shade when you have a FusionSolar solar array on your home.
